# Exercises

level 1: 
---------

1.  Create a program ```name_info.py``` that asks the user to enter their name and their age. 
Print out a message addressed to them that tells them the year they were born in. 
 
2.  Create a program ```odd_or_even_numbers.py``` that asks the user for a number. 
Depending on whether the number is even or odd, print out an appropriate message. 
 
3.  Create a program ```list_less_than_5.py```  
use this list:  
```ages = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]```  
Write a program that creates a new list that has all the elements  
less than 5 from ```ages``` list and print out all the elements of the new list.  
  
4.  Create a program ```divider.py```  
that asks the user for a number and then prints out  
a list of all the divisors of that number.  
(If you donâ€™t know what a divisor is,  
it is a number that divides evenly into another number.  
For example, 13 is a divisor of 26 because 26 / 13 has no remainder.)
