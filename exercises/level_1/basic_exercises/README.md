# Basic Exercises  
  
    
(1)  Create a program ```name_info.py``` that asks the user to enter their name and their age. 
Print out a message addressed to them that tells them the year they were born in. 
  
(2)  Create a program ```odd_or_even_numbers.py``` that asks the user for a number. 
Depending on whether the number is even or odd, print out an appropriate message. 
  
  
(3)  Create a program ```list_less_than_5.py```  
use this list:  
```ages = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]```  
Write a program that creates a new list that has all the elements  
less than 5 from ```ages``` list and print out all the elements of the new list.  
  
  
(4)  Create a program ```divider.py```  
that asks the user for a number and then prints out  
a list of all the divisors of that number.  
(If you donâ€™t know what a divisor is,  
it is a number that divides evenly into another number.  
For example, 13 is a divisor of 26 because 26 / 13 has no remainder.)  
   
   
(5)  Create a program ```common_list.py```  
that takes two lists:  
```  a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]```  
```  b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]```  
and returns a list that contains only the elements that  
are common between the lists (without duplicates).  
Make sure your program works on two lists of different sizes.  
  
  
(6)  Create a program ```palindrome.py```  
that asks the user for a string and print out  
whether this string is a palindrome or not.  
(A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards.)
